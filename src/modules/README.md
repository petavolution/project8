# Game Module: Integrated NASA-inspired Modules

This directory contains modular components adapted from the NASA module for use in the game:
- assets/: Asset management scripts and manifests
- config/: Game configuration structure
- controls/: User input and camera controls
- preload/: Asset preloader for smooth startup

Each submodule is designed for easy extension and integration with the main game logic.
